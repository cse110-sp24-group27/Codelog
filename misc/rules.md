## Primary Means of Communication and Expectations
All members are expected to be active (daily) on Slack and attentive of emails related to the course. Members are encouraged to respond as soon as possible and are welcome to speak their mind at all times.

## Scheduling Meetings
**Weekly meeting times**:
1. Monday: 3:00pm - 4:00pm
2. Wednesday: 8:30pm - 10:00pm

Members are expected to set reminders for these meetings and attend all if possible. If unable to attend, members must reach out and thoroughly state their absence to the rest of the team to avoid miscommunication.

## General Responsibilities for All Team Members
Follow the three key values of Trust, Respect, and Communication. Go over all notifications on Slack to avoid missing key team discussions and information. Be active within the group, examples include voicing one's opinion, bringing up specific matters related to deliverables, etc. Promote psychological safety of the group: be friendly, avoid conflicts, be willing to help others in need. 

When given tasks and expected deliverables, contribute towards a solid effort in completing such. Provide assistance to members when appropriate or asked upon. Make changes within seperate branches and create pull requests; no direct commits without team lead permission.

**Team Lead**: Planning out assignments and timeframes. Keeping track of deadlines and submissions. Efficiently distribute tasks to suitable team members. Communicate with Members, TA, and Professor effectively.

**Designer** (suggestive): Contribute to overall User Interface and User Experience design choices while being the appropriate reference for such concerns.

**Notetaker** (suggestive): Be consistent and take quality notes that reflect the meeting disucssion. Attend all meetings to avoid inconsistencies while having a strong recollection of what was discussed to explain meeting minutes. 

## Conflict Resolution
- When team member constantly fails to meet deadlines, the member will have a 1 on 1 session with a Team Lead to better understand the underlying reasons for such.
- Any form of disagreement should be addressed by first voting as a group after subsequent discussion of both ends. If no agreement has been settled upon, the Team Leads will co-vote with guidance from the TA. 
  - Discussion materials could include (suggestive): pros/cons table, different coding implementations and their respective output, etc.
  - In terms of technical discussions, try to always loop back to minimalism and keeping things simple.
- Addition of unapproved code would be resolved by voluntary identification of such code, and proper usage of Github issues and pull requests. This also applies to individual decisions that were made without consulting the rest of the team.
