# Project Concept

## Context and Problem Statement
During the brainstorming phase, we were deciding between many project ideas. We considered each of their accessiblities, features, implementation, and ease of use.

## Considered Options

* Random Sentiment: VSC extension that randomly asks users how are they feeling during a coding session.
* Version Storage: VSC extension that stores multiple versions of a file that you can switch between.
* Clipborad: Storage for code that you are deleting now to test something new.
* Template Journal: Web app that stores your porjects and journals, as well as widget that let you select code snippets and make journal entry with a given template.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Template Journal.

Reason: It is something that we would use, it is easier to fill out dev journals when we are given the template. The web app provides a clean and organize place to showcase the projects and workflow.
