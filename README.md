[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/8d725010d37a477684db11331ee95641)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/cse110-sp24-group27/cse110-sp24-group27/dashboard?utm_source=gh&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=&utm_campaign=Badge_grade)

How can developers integrate the features of a personal website, developer journal, and project hosting platform into a unified web application, providing recruiters with a comprehensive view of their skills and development process?

Introducing Codelog: a user-centric developer journal designed to illuminate and share the intricate journey of passion projects. Our web application prioritizes the seamless viewing and sharing of the development process. Harnessing the power of local storage, Codelog ensures the security of your projects by offering encryption options, allowing users to retain full control. Additionally, users have the flexibility to toggle project visibility, choosing between public and private settings. Customize your profile, meticulously outline project specifications, and effortlessly craft beautifully formatted journal entries with our intuitive software.

## Usage
We deployed our web app using Github Pages which you can access with this link: [deployed](https://cse110-sp24-group27.github.io/cse110-sp24-group27/home_projects_page.html). This also means that the user will not have to install any dependencies to use the web app and will just initially need a functioning web browser to access it.
