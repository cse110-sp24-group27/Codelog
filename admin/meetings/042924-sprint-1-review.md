### Review: Show Off Work
- Show off what each group made
- Group 1:
  - Made the task list widget
  - Tasks have names, priorities, and dates
  - Can mark tasks as done and add new tasks
- Group 2:
  - Made the sentiment ranking widget
  - When selecting a ranking, the corresponding amount of stars light up
  - Can use both keyboard and mouse to select
