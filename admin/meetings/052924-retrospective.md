## Content


### Reflection
- Positives:
  - Good communication within each small team
  - `localStorage` document was detailed and easy to use
- Negatives:
  - More documentation would help others working on the same task understand what the code is doing

### Changes to Plans
- We will remove templates: instead, let the user format and add manually to each journal entry
- We will change the structure of projects in our app: now projects will only have journal entries, each of which contains the content users create

## Plan of Action
- Create ADRs for our planned changes
