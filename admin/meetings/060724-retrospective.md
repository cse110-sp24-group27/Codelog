## Content

### -Ilities
- We prioritized functionality over everything; we wanted to get everything working seemlessly
- Since we kept everything simple in our design, our performance efficiency is decent
- Our maintainability is not bad; the code is mostly documented and understandable
- We could've focused more on security if we had time (public/private projects)
- We also could've focused more on accessibility with time

### Potential Improvements
- Our in-person coding session was super productive; more short group coding sessions would really improve our efficiency and communication (mobbing)
- Try to better pace ourselves and plan sprints so that we don't have to rush towards the end
- Designs could've been better fleshed out before we started coding
- Try to schedule deadlines around the developers' schedules better and work around them
- Communicate changes in design or code structure better
- Use Jira more to update others on progress (perhaps make tasks more specific or better organize assigned tasks)
- Could use less tools (maybe move the Jira tasks to Miro for example)
- The stand-up bot was great; that could be used more in the future
