### Meeting Recap
- In the future, instead of having meeting recaps everyone can check the meeting minutes
- Last meeting, we went over the team contract and had everyone sign it

- Exercise is due Friday 4/26
- Deliverables are an implementation of a widget, video demonstration of the widget, and SWOT analysis
- Widget choices:
  - Sentiment rating
  - Task list
  - Calendar for navigation
- Split into 2 teams of 5:
  - Team 1 in charge of the task list (should be more comfortable with web dev)
  - Team 2 in charge of the sentiment rating widget
  - If we have time, work on calendar together
- Team 1: Hayden, Kris, Timothy, Spencer, Sang
- Team 2: David, Josh, Fiona, Selina, Devan
