## Content


### Showcase Miro
- Added a flowchart for how the app should work
- Cleaned up page designs

### Address Issues
- How to stylize Markdown in the journal entry page?
  - Potentially use `marked.js` library to convert to HTML

### Auto-Documentation
- We currently have auto-documentation for JS files (likely enough)
  - Make sure to comment JS code correctly so that JSDoc works
  - Works on all files in the `source/assets` directory
- Use [this guide](https://michaelcurrin.github.io/dev-cheatsheets/cheatsheets/javascript/general/jsdoc.html) to create correctly formatted comments for JSDoc

### Sprint Assignments
- Need to have two sprint reviews and retrospectives done by the end of the course
- We are setting the deadline for the first sprint to be Wednesday (5/29)
  - Includes HTML structure, CSS styling, JS integration, and database implementation
  - Finish all currently assigned tasks on the Jira board
- Sprint review/retrospective will be done on Wednesday
- Sprint video is due Sunday (5/26); individual clips should be done by Saturday and sent to Hayden

## Plan of Action
- Continue working on tasks
- Record individual clips for the sprint video
