### Retrospective: Group Reflection
- Group 1:
  - Starting with research really helped
  - Programming was easier after research
  - Comments were helpful to find bugs
  - Designing an outline before programming would have been helpful
- Group 2:
  - Planning phase was pretty rough
    - Didn't do enough research
    - Thought about the details too much
  - Utilize the Double Diamond process more
  - Did well to work together and overcome lack of experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    - Can better delegate tasks in the future now that we have more experience

### Retrospective: Takeaways
- Start with research
- Be more organized with the building process
- Design a rough outline of the project before programming (like a drawing or diagram)
- Use of GitHub issues was helpful
- Testing and quality assurance is important
- Use more comments in code to make it easier for others to understand

## Plan of Action
