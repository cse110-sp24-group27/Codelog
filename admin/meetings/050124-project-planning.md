## Content


### ADRs
- Went over what ADRs are
  - ADRs are "any decision records"
  - Brief summary of changes and decisions we make
- Should include:
  - Decision topic
  - Decision context and problem
  - Considered options
  - Decision outcome
- We will use [this template](https://adr.github.io/madr/#full-template), and decision documents will be stored in `/specs/adrs`
- Each decision should have an individual document and formatted in MMDDYY-Decision-Name.md

### Starting Pitch
- Everyone should skim [this chapter](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/0.3-chapter-01) on what a starting pitch looks like
- Stored in `/specs/pitch`
- Max 16 slides that include: risks and rabbit holes, visual representation in the form of system diagrams and wireframes, statement of purpose, and user personas
- We will schedule a time to present the pitch to our mentor

### Brainstorm
- Held a brainstorm meeting for the project
- Brainstorm meeting notes will be stored in `/admin/meetings/mmddyy-brainstorm.md`

## Plan of Action
- Research how plausible it is to build the app we have brainstormed, and how we would go about doing it
- Work on starting pitch
