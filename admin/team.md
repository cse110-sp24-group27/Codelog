**Selina Shih (Yunfei)**:I'm third-year CS major at UCSD. I ususally like to go for walks on the beach. A big part of the reason I chose to come to UCSD was beacause of the campus is close to the beach.

**Joshua Villanueva**: My name is Joshua Villanueva and I am a low income, first generation, Computer Engineering student that transferred from Santa Barbara City College and in my free time I love to lose myself in a book, discover a new hiking trail, or go to a show with my friends. I decided to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering because I have always enjoyed robotics and have been interested in how they work. I chose to transfer to UCSD because of many reasons including its amazing location, push for innovation, and the amount of support/resources it has to offer.
